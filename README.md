# glowing-octo-guacamole is the codename for the in-development app - Studycheck.

Study Controllers can use this site to add new animals, create new studies for Study Directors and assign animals to studies.

It can also be used to 'treat' unhealthy animals and send them to a big farm that's too far away for us to visit.
